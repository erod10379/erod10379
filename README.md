- 👋 Hi, I’m @erod10379
- 👀 I’m interested in creating my own NFT's and selling them. I have creative ideas that come to mind and I think the whackier they are - the better. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create my own NFT's and then Mint in order to sell them on Openseas,io or elsewhere. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at this time. 
- 📫 How to reach me - erod10379@gmail.com - Use the Subkect Line Title "GITHUB Connection" followed by your name. Then, if I am interested in chatting I will contact you if you leave me your information.
